    Tiny Search Engine - Part 1 - Build a search index

    In this programming assingment you are given with some text documents as input.
    Complete the program below to build a search index. Don't worry, it is explained below.
    A search index is a python dictionary.
    The keys of this dictionary are words contained in ALL the input text documents.
    The values are a list of documents such that the key/word appears in each document atleast once.
    The document in the list is represented as a tuple.
    The tuple has 2 items. The first item is the document ID.
    Document ID is represented by the list index.
    For example: the document ID of the third document in the list is 2
    The second item of the tuple is the frequency of the word occuring in the document.

    Here is the sample format of the dictionary.
    {
        word1: [(doc_id, frequency),(doc_id, frequency),...],
        word2: [(doc_id, frequency),(doc_id, frequency),...],
        .
        .
    }
